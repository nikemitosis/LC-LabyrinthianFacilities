# v0.4.2

## New Features
 - You can now save the "history" of your lethal company saves. The config entry to enable is under `Debug.History`. 
   - A "history" is the sequence of seeds, moons, and interiors used over the course of a save. This history is not wiped when a run is lost, but it is deleted when a save is deleted. 
   - A History for a given save is stored at `<Lethal Company Savedata>/LabyrinthianFacilities/<Save>History.log`
