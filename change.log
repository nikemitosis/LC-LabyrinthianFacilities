 # Bugfix

 # Fixed a bug which caused Scrap/MapObjects to not be loaded properly by client
 
{}# Fixed a bug on loading saves which caused Tiles to be initialized before the map was shifted -200 units underground
    This caused tile bounds to be centered way above the ground, effectively removing tile bounds on reload
    i.e. newer tiles could generate on top of the old ones and scrap/equipment would not parent correctly

{} Moved MapHandler.InitializeMapObjects to DGameMap.InitializeMapObjects

{} Implemented GetByte and CastInto for ulong

{} Laid the groundwork to refactor serialization (not deserialization, just serialization)
	Implemented [De]Serializers for sending data about NetworkObjects to clients when they join
	Created a copy of Serializer and modified it to support the future version of serialization

{}#Fixed a bug where DeserializationContext would use the most generic deserializer specified by any reference, rather than the most specialized. 

{} Added error throwing to all patches, so now the plugin reports all errors, rather than going through unity. 
	(There are still circumstances where errors are not caught by the plugin, this is not a total solution)

{} MapObjects now serialize their position rather than their localPosition
