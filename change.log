 # Bugfix


 + Added serialization support for DTile and TileProp, allowing props to be saved/loaded
 + Added serialization support for DGameMap and Scrap, allowing scrap to be saved/loaded

 + Added compatibility with LCBetterSaves
    *Currently, the code that ensures compatibility is always enabled. It's not performance-intensive and only runs when booting up the game, so changing this is not a priority. 

 + Added scrap wiping; When everyone dies in a save, all scrap is deleted on all moons

 + Added equipment saving. Equipment is not wiped when everyone dies. (Knives and shotguns do not count as equipment, but shotgun shells and keys do)

 # Fixed a bug where MapHandler.unresolvedMaps wouldn't move its maps into MapHandler.maps, but the entry in unresolvedMaps would still be deleted
	TL;DR map load bad

#+ Fixed/added save file deletion

 # Fixed Scrap not being spawned after being deserialized
 # Fixed a bug where Scrap would always load with the map as its parent, rather than the tile it was in
    (Could've resulted in scrap that would be stuck behind walls if the tile was deleted)

 ~ Tweaked DungeonFlowConverter.tile_demand to just be the average number of main path tiles

{} Reduced prop spawning iterations from 10,000 to 1000
{} Changed DDoorway to use PropSets instead of GameObject arrays to store its blockers/doors
{} Moved Scrap from "Plugin.cs" to a new file "MapObjects.cs"
{} Refactored Scrap to extend a new class 'MapObject' to share behaviour with Equipment
{} Refactored several methods involving Scrap to be about MapObjects in general
{} Refactored Deserialization to better accomodate inlined objects and generally behave more intuitively

{} Added conditional compilation for debug logging and set seed testing
{} Changed the name of Plugin.InitializeCustomGenerator to Plugin.InitializeAssets
{} Implemented ICollection<TileProp> for TileSet
