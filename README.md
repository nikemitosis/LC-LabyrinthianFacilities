# DISCLAIMER
## EARLY DEVELOPMENT!
### EXPECT GAME-BREAKING BUGS

It is possible, if not probable, that you may encounter game-breaking bugs during development should you choose to play with this mod. It is also worth noting that the format of savedata for this mod is not at all set in stone; that is to say that updates may break savedata relevant to this mod (but other savedata like furniture, scrap, quota, etc. should be safe). 

### Mod Compatibility
It is recommended that you keep other mods to a minimum, especially those that interact with the way levels are generated. Many mods, especially simple ones like Shiploot should be fine, just know that in general mod compatibility is not yet a priority, since I'd rather get the mod working *by itself* first. 

# Object
The purpose of this mod is to provide a sense of continuity within each moon. In Vanilla LC, moons are regenerated every day from scratch, and all objects are deleted. This mod attempts to remove this discontinuity by only partially regenerating the interior, and preserving scrap and other items when the ship returns to orbit. The namesake of the mod is that interiors should act like labyrinths, closing up paths that used to be accessible, and openning new ones that didn't exist before, rather than just poofing the whole thing into existance. 

#### Disclaimer
The purpose of this mod is not to claim that the discontinuity within Vanilla LC is *inferior* from a gameplay perspective; this is subjective. This mod simply aims to act as the *option* to have this continuity in within the game for those that would enjoy it.
